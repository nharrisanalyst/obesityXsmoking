    <div class = 'step inactive'> <p>Visualizing the data in an XY plot shows the correlation between age and health insurance cost. 
      Yes age is a factor on health insurance cost as the data shows, but digging deeper the data is split into three distinct groups.
       Lets visualize these groups through drawing lines seperating them. </p>  </div>
    <div class = 'step inactive'> <p>Now that we have seperated the data into three distinct groups let's dig deeper and  highlight the differences in these groups by adding 4 categories and assign them a distinct color.  </p></div>
    <div class = 'step inactive'>  <p>The data is now visualized in four groups; individuals that are Obese and Smoke, Obese only, Smoker only, and  Non Smoker and Not Obese. Individuals with the most expensive healthcare cost at every age group can be attributed to the category smoker and they are obese.</p> </div>
    <div class = 'step inactive'> <div id='table-step'> A simple linear model that controls for age shows the additional cost of being in each subgroup as opposed to being a non smoker and not obese.

            <tr>
              <td>Obese and Smoker</td>

              </tr>
          </table>
          This result demonstrates that Smoking and being Obese incurs the medical cost of almost 3 times that of being Obese only.
